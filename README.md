# Train Scheduler
<img src="/assets/images/train_scheduler.png">
This train scheduler project creates and schedule for all the trains that you input, grabbing your data input(train name, destination, starting time, and frequency). Using the moment js library and your starting time and comparing it to the actual time you are able to see what time your next time would arrive(in minutes) depending on your initial input. All this is done using firebase as our database to store the user's input and then displayiing it on the browser using jquery.

## Getting Started
